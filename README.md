# Twimg

Twimg is the result of the technical challenge that I was asked to complete to enter Cheerz, a company I previously worked for as a FrontEnd Developer.


The rules were : using the technologies of your choice, create a web app that, in real-time, displays the 3 latest images of tweets that contain the hashtag the user entered. (if the user enters "pizza" in the search bar, the web app displays the 3 latest images contained in tweets that also contain the hashtag #pizza).


If the tweet is older than 15 minutes, the frame around the image must be grey. If it has been posted a minute ago or less, the frame must be blue. Between the two, the frame must be orange. 

## Technologies used :
- Node.js and Express
- Twitter's API
- Vue.js
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Bulma (CSS Framework)

## Example :

## How to make it work :

Clone the repository, then 'npm install' or 'yarn install'.
Note : You'll need twitter application credentials.
